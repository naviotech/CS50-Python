“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all in. That could do with a bit 
of cleaning, too.” She pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage. “Scourgify.” A few feathers and droppings 
vanished.

Data, too, often needs to be “cleaned,” as by reformatting it, so that values are in a consistent, 
if not more convenient, format. Consider, for instance, this CSV file of students, before.csv, below:

Even though each “row” in the file has three values (last name, first name, and house), the first two 
are combined into one “column” (name), escaped with double quotes, with last name and first 
name separated by a comma and space. Not ideal if Hogwarts wants to send a form letter to each 
student, as via mail merge, since it’d be strange to start a letter with:

Dear Potter, Harry,

Rather than with, for instance:

Dear Harry,

In a file called scourgify.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to provide two command-line arguments:
the name of an existing CSV file to read as input, whose columns are assumed to be, in order, name and 
house, and
the name of a new CSV to write as output, whose columns should be, in order, first, last, and house.
Converts that input to that output, splitting each name into a first name and last name. Assume that 
each student will have both a first name and last name.
If the user does not provide exactly two command-line arguments, or if the first cannot be read, the 
program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

if not sys.argv[1].endswith(".csv"):
