Perhaps the most popular place for pizza in Harvard Square is Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, aka Noch’s, 
known for its Sicilian pizza, which is “a deep-dish or thick-crust pizza.”

Students tend to buy pizza by the slice, but Pinocchio’s also has whole pizzas on its menu too, per this 
CSV file of Sicilian pizzas, sicilian.csv, below:

Sicilian Pizza,Small,Large
Cheese,$25.50,$39.95
1 item,$27.50,$41.95
2 items,$29.50,$43.95
3 items,$31.50,$45.95
Special,$33.50,$47.95
See regular.csv for a CSV file of regular pizzas as well.

Of course, a CSV file isn’t the most customer-friendly format to look at. Prettier might be a table, 
formatted as ASCII art, like this one:

+------------------+---------+---------+
| Sicilian Pizza   | Small   | Large   |
+==================+=========+=========+
| Cheese           | $25.50  | $39.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 1 item           | $27.50  | $41.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 2 items          | $29.50  | $43.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 3 items          | $31.50  | $45.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| Special          | $33.50  | $47.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
In a file called pizza.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, 
the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s format, and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art 
using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the library’s 
grid format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s 
name does not end in .csv, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via 
sys.exit.

import sys
from tabulate import tabulate
import csv

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("Too few command-line arguments")
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    sys.exit("Too many command-line arguments")
if not sys.argv[1].endswith(".csv"):
    sys.exit("Not a CSV file")

try:
    with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as file:
        lines= tabulate((csv.DictReader(file)), headers="keys", tablefmt="grid")
        print(lines)
except FileNotFoundError:
    sys.exit("File does not exist")
