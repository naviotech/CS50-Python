Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, 
a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then 
outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

answer= input().replace(" ", "...")
print(answer)
