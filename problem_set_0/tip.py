'''
Well, we’ve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, 
we didn’t have time to implement two functions:

dollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as $##.##, wherein each # is a 
decimal digit), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 
as input, it should return 50.0.
percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as ##%, wherein each # is a 
decimal digit), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float. For instance, 
given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.
Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.
